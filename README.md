<h3>Magic dots</h3>
<h5>I had to implement this solution for a site. <br>
  It was required to create a method that was very visually effective and also easy to modify and adapt to other contexts.<br>
  This clock was born that marks the current time made up of dots that interact through gravity and the mouse cursor when it passes over them.<br>
  The concept can also be applied to static text or images.</h5>
